Results showed that polyurethane liners had a lower compressive elasticity than silicone. This suggests that peak pressures are more easily distributed across the limb as mentioned previously. In addition, as the compressive values are still relatively high the stability between limb and socket is greater as there is a lower liner deformation. Skin health and wound healing of the limb are essential to improve comfort while using the prosthesis. Unwanted shear stresses on the stump have been found to delay the wound healing process and produce skin irritation. Polyurethane offers a similar high shear elasticity as silicone, therefore facilitating the even distribution of shear stress across the stump. The main issue related to polyurethane liners is their low coefficient of friction and low thermal conductivity, which suggest a poor ability to adhere to the residual limb and less stability.
